## 📊 Metrics Explained
| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Market Cap | Company's total market value in billions ($). Calculated by multiplying the total number of outstanding shares by the current share price |
| Earnings | Company's total profit in billions ($). Represents the net income after all expenses and taxes |
| Revenue | Total income generated from sales of goods and services in billions ($) before any costs or expenses are deducted |
| Employees | Total number of full-time employees working for the company |
| P/E Ratio | Price-to-Earnings ratio measures the relationship between a company's stock price and its earnings per share.
