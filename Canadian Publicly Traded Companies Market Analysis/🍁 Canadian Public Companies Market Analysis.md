## üìä Metrics Explained
| Metric     | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Market Cap | Company's total market value in billions ($). Calculated by multiplying the total number of outstanding shares by the current share price |
| Earnings   | Company's total profit in billions ($). Represents the net income after all expenses and taxes |
| Revenue    | Total income generated from sales of goods and services in billions ($) before any costs or expenses are deducted |
| Employees  | Total number of full-time employees working for the company |
| P/E Ratio  | Price-to-Earnings ratio measures the relationship between a company's stock price and its earnings per share.
